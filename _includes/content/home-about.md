# About

I'm Lioncash (A.K.A. Lioncache). I usually contribute to projects relating to hardware emulation. Currently I'm a core developer and maintainer of the [Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org), an emulator for the Nintendo GameCube and Wii consoles, and the [Citra Emulator](https://citra-emu.org), an emulator for the Nintendo 3DS.
