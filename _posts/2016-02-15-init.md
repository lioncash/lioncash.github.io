I started a blog for when I feel like writing about stuff. I've been getting sporadic urges to write about miscellaneous
programming and emulation topics over the past few weeks. To be quite honest, I don't know why I've been getting said urges; brains are great that way.

So, whenever I get one of those urges I'll probably do a brain dump of whatever I feel like writing about here.
