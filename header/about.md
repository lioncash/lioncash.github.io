I'm Lioncash (A.K.A. Lioncache). I usually contribute to projects relating to hardware emulation.
Currently I'm a core developer and maintainer of the [Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org), an
emulator for the Nintendo GameCube and Wii consoles, and the [Citra Emulator](https://citra-emu.org),
an emulator for the Nintendo 3DS.

I'm usually on Freenode under the handle Lioncash. I also have a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/Lioncache) I can be reached at.

### Theme Credits

This site theme is a slightly modified version of Kiko (the original is developed by [@gfjaru](https://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko))
