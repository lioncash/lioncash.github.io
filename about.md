I'm Mat M. (A.K.A. Lioncash or Lioncache)! I'm a software developer based out of Canada, currently located in Ottawa, Ontario. I've previously studied Computer Science at the University of Ottawa and Computer Programming at Algonquin College. I'm extremely interested in tooling, low-level emulation and reverse engineering. In particular, I love working around instruction set architectures, seeing how things tick, and optimizing around them, even if I still have a lot to learn.

I usually contribute to projects relating to hardware emulation. Currently I'm a core developer and maintainer of [Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org), a Nintendo GameCube and Wii emulator; [Citra](https://citra-emu.org), a Nintendo 3DS emulator; [yuzu](http://yuzu-emu.org), a Nintendo Switch emulator; and [dynarmic](https://github.com/MerryMage/dynarmic), an ARM dynamic recompiler.
